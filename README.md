[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sonatype-nexus-community/intentionally-vulnerable-golang-project.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sonatype-nexus-community/intentionally-vulnerable-golang-project)

This is just a minimal repo for testing Sonatype's `nancy` against an intentionally vulnerable list of 
dependencies, and as well showing a small example of how to use it in Travis-CI.
